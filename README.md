# project_game - Platform game
Created with CodeSandbox

##Introduction
This is my course project work (CT30A2910 Introduction to Web Programming). Along the course I learned basics of HTML, CSS and Javascrip. For the course project I decided to do game because it inspired me the most out of the options given. It is simple platform game where player tries to collect stars and wacth out for black stars as they give minus points and look out for the deadly bombs.

##Tools
I used CodeSandbox as a coding platform and it's browser to display the game. In the game I took advantage the Phaser framework. For the game sounds I used freesound website (https://freesound.org/) to download sound effects and AudioMass (https://audiomass.co/) to edit/convert them to mp3. I also used Pixlr (https://pixlr.com/fi/x/) to personalize the game objects to little bit them.

##The game structure
The game starts at main menu page where the player can choose the desired difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) by clicking it. The player controls the game character with the arrow keys. In the hard level player need to use mouse to move a platform horizontally. The game end when player hits a bomb. 

###At the beginning
The game mainly followed the platformer course material and all the js codes were in one js file. When I started to add Main menu page I reliazed
